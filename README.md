# 今日は！ I'm Ammon Turner

Thank you for stopping by my GitHub page! I'm a passionate Software Developer who loves turning ideas into reality with a dash of creativity and a whole lot of code. I'm always exicted to try something new, whether it's building an inspiring web app, analyzing data trends, or automating everyday tasks, I relish a challenge.

## My Background

I'm a Software Developer who got started in IT support and Network Administration before shifting from a hardware to a software focus. My professional background includes Network Administration, Website creation and maintenance, and a bit of time in customer support and marketing (I'm a believer that a diverse background is a strength). I love using code to solve problems and make life and computers easier for everyone. I like to tell people that one of my life and professional goals is to make as many people happy as I can.

## My Toolbox

Here's a peek at some of the technologies I enjoy working with:
- Languages: C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL
- Frameworks/Tools: .NET, Razor, Git, Domo, REST APIs
- Platforms: Windows, Linux, GitHub, AWS (S3, Lightsail, Cloud9)
- Other Skills: Network Administration, Server Maintenance, SEO Optimization

## My Favorite Code

Here are a few highlights from my repositories:
- [CIS301-huffman](https://github.com/NightMarethyu/CIS301-huffman): This is a project that I did during my undergrad studies. It is an implementation of the Huffman encoding algorithm written in C++. I'm proud of this because while the assignment was designed as a group project, and I did my best to lead the group, I ended up writing all the code and I got lots of extra credit because my code was some of the fastest in the class.
- [final-project-NightMarethyu-main](https://github.com/NightMarethyu/final-project-NightMarethyu-main): This is a MERN app that I built as the final project in one of 400 level classes for my undergrad. It's designed as an app that will allow people to share their availabbility with others to make planning group events easier (I wanted something to make game night easier to play). You'll notice the commit history is sparse on this one, because I had to create a copy of the repo to make the code public.

### Current WIPs

I've got a few personal projects that I'm working on and you can see what I've been doing in these repositories:
- [console_rpg_app](https://github.com/NightMarethyu/console_rpg_app): This is a C# text-based adventure RPG that I've been working on. I really like how it is coming together to be an interesting story of exploration and adventure. I'm using it as a way to improve my understanding of design patterns, data structures, and project planning and development.
- [ultimate-tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/NightMarethyu/ultimate-tic-tac-toe): This is a MERN app I've started to build a playable version of [Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe). With a React frontend for engaging state management and an Express backend for a robust API, I am excited for this project to get completed.

## Educational Background

I'm a proud graduate of BYU–Hawaiʻi with a B.S. in Computer Science (Summa Cum Laude, CGPA 3.97!), and minors in Economics and Japanese. I also hold an IT Networking Certification from OWATC. Always learning, always growing!

## When I'm Not Coding...
You might find me:
- Spending time with my beautiful wife and kid
- Binging a recently released anime season (Anyone else a fan of DanMachi?)
- Playing Table-top games (I love anything from a well-structured TTRPG to a complex board game to simple card games)
